Hello, this project was intended only for my development in the field of front-end and back-end. A large amount of functionality is described here.

Now I will briefly tell you how to launch my project so that there are no errors and everything is better than ever:

!  IMPORTANT  !
This instruction assumes that you have basic things like vsc and python.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: clone my repository to your device.
Step 2: unzip the static folder and move it to your repository.
Step 3: open a new terminal using the key combination "Ctrl + `" and enter the following commands there:
   pip install Flask
   pip install psycopg2
-If you are using a system with multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip:
   pip3 install Flask
   pip3 install psycopg2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  Next, you need to create a new PostgreSQL database above, and insert the code from the queryes.txt file there and also connect it in the Python file in connection.
  Substitute instead of host - 78.141.227.124 - lolalhost and the name of your database.

  Next, run the Python file and enjoy the site!
